# Chime
An editor for macOS

Version [2.2.1][download] is now free and available as a beta download.

Goals:
- develop modular, open source components
- be an editor people enjoy using
- support cool [extensions][chimekit]

Features:
- completions
- command line tool
- document/project-scoped search
- [extensions][chimekit]
- file navigator
- syntax highlighting (driven by tree-sitter and LSP)
- structure highlighting
- semantic symbol information
- textual/symbolic quick open
- UI theming

## Project State

The code in this repo should be considered **Non-Functional** right now. You can [download][download] the currently released version.

Chime used to be commercial, but is now [free][download]. It built up some pretty significant cruft over time. In particular, the core UI application architecture is just in a bad state. It is also quite complex to build. So, I've opted to re-implement that core and pull in parts as appropriate. I'll be putting an emphasis on extracting components into packages as I go. A fitting rebirth, I would say.

## Contributing

It is always a good idea to **discuss** before taking on a significant task. That said, I have a strong bias towards enthusiasm. If you are excited about doing something, I'll do my best to get out of your way.

There are a few areas that would make for excellent targets though, if you really feel so inclined.

- It would be really interesting to explore the [TreeSitterDocument](https://github.com/ChimeHQ/SwiftTreeSitter#treesitterdocument) concept
- I'd love to expand on more [universal theme support](https://github.com/chimeHQ/ThemePark)
- The text search system is bad and I'd love to build something better
- The view-based [extension system][chimekit] could really use some more attention
- I'd like to finish migrating the preferences to SwiftUI
- Support for the [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://github.com/ChimeHQ/DebugAdapterProtocol)

### Building
 
- clone the repo
- `cp User.xcconfig.template User.xcconfig`
- update `User.xcconfig` with your personal information
- build/run with Xcode 15+

### Guidelines

- SwiftUI where possible, AppKit where useful
- using packages is a wonderful way to support open source software
- supporting older versions of macOS is nice, not critical

### Conventions

- tabs for indentation
- configuration in xcconfig files
- project resources are sorted alphabetically
- imports are sorted by alphabetically, but parititioned to system/non-system
